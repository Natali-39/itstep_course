   <h3><font color="#1b27ab">ACT 1</font></h3>
   <h3><font color="#1b27ab">PROLOGUE</font></h3>

   <p dir="ltr">Two households, both alike in dignity, <br>
   In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
   From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
   Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
   From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
   A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
   Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
   Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br>
   The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
   Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
   Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
   The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
   What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

   <h3><font color="#1b27ab">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</font></h3>

   <p><i><small>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</small></i></p>

   <h3><font color="#1b27ab">SAMPSON</font></h3>

   <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

   <h3><font color="#1b27ab">GREGORY</font></h3>

   <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
